mixpanel-qt with buffered tracking
===========

Qt library for mixpanel

Originally written by [jdauphant](https://github.com/jdauphant/mixpanel-qt). 

I mainly added buffered tracking, along with some small modifications to some orginal functions and variables.

The library depends on qjson, which can be acquired [here](http://qjson.sourceforge.net/). To make it work, you may need to modify the link to qjson library in the src.pro file.

Tested on Qt 4.8.5
